"""
main.py

This module defines the entry point for running the main logic of the program.
It checks for the existence of a `.env` file and ensures that the program should
only run if certain conditions are met. If the conditions are not met, the program
will notify the user and exit early.

The `main()` function orchestrates the setup and execution of the program, and it
only runs the core functionality if the environment is correctly configured.
